Converts a contour line image to a grayscale heightmap.
Generates a heightmap where the outer regions are lower and the inner regions are higher.

Only support simple images. Assume all contours are closed in the image and they don't overlap, etc.

# How to Use
Run
```bash
cargo run "path_to_your_input_image"
```

Environment Variables
- `OUTPUT_PATH`: if this is set, the program will save the heightmap to the file.
- `FILL_MODE`: `0` is flat fill, and `1` is linear fill.

## Flat Fill (FILL_MODE 0)
Flat fill is done with an approach similar to the fill tool in mspaint.
<img width="3545" height="687" alt="FLAT" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3c1475-29a0-4690-978a-04bfe356d8e3" />

## Linear Fill (FILL_MODE 1)
Linear fill finds nearest points on the nearest countours and linear interpolate.
<img width="3541" height="687" alt="LINEAR" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36191a86-c86c-472d-8310-dff48e9857ed" />

`contours2heightmap` does not provide heightmap to 3D model conversion. The demo 3D model is generated by [Heightmap Viewer](https://procgenesis.com/SimpleHMV/simplehmv.html).
